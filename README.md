Mini Kossel V-Slot

UltiBots LLC wants to thank Johann C. Rocholl for his groundbreaking work on the Rostock and Kossel 3D Printers.  Your Mini Kossel V-Slot Kit was derived from his work.

We recommend printing all parts ABS for thermal reasons. The lower corner frame printed parts may warp if printed in PLA due to NEMA heat and the Micro Extruder body must be printed in ABS to withstand the J-Head temperatures.
